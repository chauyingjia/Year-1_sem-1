On the 23th of November, we had a lab learning on PC assemble. This is the first time I get to uninstall and assemble a PC by myself with my groupmates.
I learnt the steps to uninstall the every pieces in the PC and assemble back correctly.
In my opinion, hands-on work is the best way for us to understand or to master a skill or to understand the hardware. I appreciate and hope to have more hands-on 
works or projects in the future so that we could really learn from it and gain more experience from those practises. <br/> <br/> <br/>
