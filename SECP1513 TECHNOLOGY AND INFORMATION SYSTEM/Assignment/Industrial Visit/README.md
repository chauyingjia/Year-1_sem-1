<h2>Reflection on industry vist and industry talks ðŸ’¬</h2>
Over the course of the semester, I had the opportunity to visit three exceptional places - Huawei, Petronas, and UTM Digital. These visits allowed me to explore various technologies and high-tech products that have been invented by them. I was particularly impressed by Huawei's inventions, Petronas' work from home style, which showcased the fast-paced technology in our world, and the data center in UTM, which is the heart of the institution. These visits and talks expanded my knowledge and deepened my interest in this field.

From the talks given by these industries, I realized the importance of cooperation among departments to effectively control and manage a system or company. Every staff member has a crucial role in ensuring the smooth functioning of the company.

Unfortunately, the visits were somewhat rushed, and we could not explore the places properly. I hope that in the future, we can allocate enough time to explore and have leisure time to rest and walk around.

Overall, these visits and talks have enriched my understanding and experience in this field. I look forward to the next opportunity to visit and learn from other industries.
