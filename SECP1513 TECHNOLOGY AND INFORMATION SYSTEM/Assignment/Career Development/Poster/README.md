On the first talk given by Mr Habib, he encouraged us to start our journey in writing our resume or portfolio from now on rather then writing it after we graduated.
One of the reason is it is better to do step by step, semester to semester rather than packing it after we graduate. We might miss out many important things if we prepare it at the last minute.
After the talk given by him,I feel like starting to write my portfolio since now filling them up one by one so that my portfolio are complete and in a good arrangement. 

For the talk given by PPG, it is an apportunity for me to know more about our careers after we graduate. They provide us information on our future careers and how we should face the problems we met shared by our alumni.
It is better to have my own career development plan from now on as it is a long-term plan and goals. It helps me to make a concrete plans to get there when I graduate. I would try my best to get more experiences no matter is from my coursework or internships to become an outstanding one. 
The quote I have learned from these talk is "learning nonstop". We must keep learning and keep updating our skills to become a better one.
