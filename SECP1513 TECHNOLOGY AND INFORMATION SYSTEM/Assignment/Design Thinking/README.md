This project marks a significant milestone in my degree program. Our initial task was to interview an individual, identify their problem, propose several solutions, and select the optimal approach for finalization. The subsequent steps involved designing a prototype, testing it, and requesting feedback for further refinement. 
Throughout the process, I realized the significance of collaboration among group members. A cohesive team can complete a project professionally and promptly. I learned the value of working with others to achieve our objectives. Additionally, it's essential to begin work early to avoid rushing and incomplete deliverables.
I'm proud of our team's ability to solve a real-world problem identified by our interviewee. I look forward to have more such projects that will enhance my problem-solving abilities, a vital skill for computer science students. I hope to gain more hands-on experience and learning opportunities in the future.
We employ various mediums to showcase our ideas and products, including reports, slides, videos, and prototypes. The experience has been a valuable opportunity for me to acquire new skills, such as creating project videos, which I had not attempted previously.
