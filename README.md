# Year1_sem1

I've meticulously documented my progress throughout this semester. It includes all the courses I took and what I've done. I learned much things that I have not been taught before. 
Before I start my degree, I was worried about do I really choose the correct path? Do I really get to master my subjects well?. My confidence in mastering these subjects was quite low. Despite this, I've dedicated 
myself wholeheartedly, striving hard to understand these concepts and basics even if I myself require more time than my peers. I have put my efforts in it and I do work hard on it. Reflecting on my journey, I can 
confidently declare that I've gained a strong grasp of the fundamentals. This feeling of accomplishment fuels my determination, making me say, "I did it!" It's immensely satisfied to see my hard work pay off in 
the successful completion of my first semester. But this achievements are not the end of my growth; instead, it serves as a stepping stone to an unending pursuit of improvement.
